                    <li>
                        African women are almost 50% of the continents population

                    <li>
                        Rural women in Africa are at a significant risk of being adversely affected by climate change
                        due to household responsibilities and increased agricultural work and displacement resulting
                        from climate impacts. Not to mention, in the wake of disasters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Women and children in Africa are 80% of those in need of assistance while, poor women are 14
                        times more like to die during a natural disaster.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Almost 40% agricultural workforce in 46 of 53 African countries are women.

                    <li>
                        They represent just 15% of landholders, and 70% of the continent's food is produced by women.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The gender gap in information, communication and technology (ICT) in Africa is 23%.

                    <li>
                        African Women are heavily reliant on environment- related livelihoods ….. working in
                        disproportionately climate-exposed sectors such as agriculture and livestock management,
                        forestry, water management, and health.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Existing inequalities facing women and girls limit sustainable and equitable transition to
                        resilient water- energy-food systems especially in the most climate change prone areas.

                <p class="news-p">

                    Investing in youth is investing in a climate resilient future. Girls have the agility needed to
                    counter the crises. With their talents and equipping them with education, we will respond better.

                <p class="news-p">

                    As financing being one of the major obstacles, there is an urgent need for directing more finance
                    for increasing women’s meaningful participation in the resilient water, agriculture and energy
                    management sectors.
